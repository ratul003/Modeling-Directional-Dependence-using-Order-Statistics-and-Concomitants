### Modeling-Directional-Dependence-using-Order-Statistics-and-Concomitants
Constructed a new linear model random algorithm to exhibit bivariate directional dependence using Normal and Uniform Probability Distributions. The randomly generated algorithm modeled directional support using various combinations of model parameters that were randomly simulated, satisfying certain conditions in the form of (NxN) matrices that helped identify the strong bivariate directional dependency in a given dataset.
